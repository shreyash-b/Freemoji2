# Send Emojis on Discord Cross Servers without Nitro

Using this plugin you can send emoji from other server and animated emotes without having Nitro. This works by automatically replacing selected emoji with a corresponding image link.

## This is a working port of [QbDesu's Freemoji Better Discord Plugin](https://github.com/QbDesu/BetterDiscordAddons/tree/potato/Plugins/Freemoji)
All the credits for developing this plugin goes to QbDesu.
I've only done the work of fixing the plugin after it was broken recently.
